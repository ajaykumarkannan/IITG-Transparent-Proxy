IITG Transparent Proxy would like to thank the following for their contributions:
(Past, present and future) Users, Testers and Debuggers
Redsocks (http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks/) - an opensource transparent socks redirector that wouldn't work by itself in IITG
ProxyDroid (http://code.google.com/p/proxydroid/) - the open source android app that worked and showed how it can be done
Mini fake DNS server (http://code.activestate.com/recipes/491264-mini-fake-dns-server/) - a small fake dns server conforming to protocol
Me (Suhail Sherif) and Ajaykumar Kannan - for developing it.
iptables - for being so awesome

TODO - Removing cache entries, Licensing, GUI, packaging and Improvements (Includes analysis of the working of the IITG DNS)

HOWTO:
(Most of these commands may need superuser priveleges)

In the redsocks folder, just make redsocks and get the executable.

Run sh redsocksConfig.sh <proxy_ip> <proxy_port> <username> <password>
(username and password are optional. You can edit this file to make it prompt you for the username and password if you don't like your credentials in plaintext in your history. And have it delete the redsocksauto.conf that it creates in the redsocks folder.)

Run python fakeDNS.py
(defaultIPs has some domains and ip addresses that you might want to have preconfigured)

Run sh script (it uses iptables to redirect internet through this application and dns server)

IMPORTANT:
Edit /etc/resolv.conf and add a line 'nameserver 127.0.0.1' at the top. Or add 127.0.0.1 to your DNS serverlist. The former seems cooler.

Beware! Non-authentic DNS servers can be used VERY convincingly for phishing. Make sure you are in control of your configuration.
